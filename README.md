Yuka is a JavaScript library for developing Game AI.

* **Autonomous Agent Design:** Yuka provides a basic game entity concept and classes for state-driven and goal-driven agent design.
* **Steering:** Use the build-in vehicle model and steering behaviors in order to develop moving game entities.
* **Navigation:** Graph classes, search algorithms and a navigation mesh implementation enables advanced path finding.
* **Perception:** Create game entities with a short-term memory and a vision component.
* **Trigger:** Use triggers to generate dynamic actions in your game.
* **Fuzzy Logic:** Make your game entities smarter with Yuka's fuzzy inference system.
* **JSON:** Save and load the current state of your game by using a serialization/deserialization API based on JSON.

Yuka is a standalone library and independent of a particular 3D engine.
